* An object is a reference in Python.

* An alias is any two or more variables that reference the same object.

* An instance is an object that contains properties/attributes of a class

* '==' can be used to check of two variables are identical

* The 'is' keyword in Pyhton can be used to check if variables are linked.

* Mutable types are data types that can be changed and Immutable types are
  vice versa.

* Built-in mutable types include lists, integers, frozensets,etc.

* Built-in immutable types include strings, etc.

* Tuples, due to their compound nature, could be either mutable or immutable, depending on
  what data type it contains.
