Python is still Awesome!

* Unittest is an even bigger topic than the entire task...

* Python provided numerous methods/platforms for testing code, unittest is one
  of them. Python also has third-party testing tools and bots for intense
  production testing.

* In large projects, doctest would become cumbersome, this is where unittest
  comes in. It takes the OOP syntax making it easier to implement and manage.

* Serialization is the conversion of a datatype to JSON
* Deserialization is simply the reverse

* * *args* is a special argument receiver in Python that allows a variable
  number of arguments...

* * *kwargs* is another special python keyword that allows for a dictionary
  argument to be passed. kwargs is simply short for key: word args :)
