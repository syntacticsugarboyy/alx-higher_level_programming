Lists are very powerful data types in Python. They can contain other data types whether similar
or different. They are aslo easy to manipulate and python has built-in manipulation methods.
Unlike strings that are immutable, Lists are very much mutable(contents can be changed).
Lists can also be used as stacks and queues... Appending and popping at the first and last positions
resemble the LIFO(Last In First Out) and FIFO(First In First Out) principles that stacks and queues
operate on.
List comprehensions are a concise means of creating lists, They are clearer, more readable ways of creating lists.
Tuples are somewhat similar to lists in the sense that they also contain other data types including lists
but they are also different from lists as they are immutable, denoted with () and the contained data can be
accessed via unpacking unlike iteration in lists.
The del statement is a way of deleting datatypes or values in python
