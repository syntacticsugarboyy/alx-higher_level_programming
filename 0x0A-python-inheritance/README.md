### Python-Inheritance

* Pyhton is Awesome! Supporting OOP means that one can take advantage of
  Inheritance.

* A Parentclass, baseclass or superclass is a class which other classes inherit

* A subclass is a class that has parentclasses/superclass/baseclass.

* The dir() method returns all the attributes and methods of a class.

* An instance can have new attributes at any time...

* To inherit another class one can just call the baseclass in parentheses when
  the subclasses is called(i.e subclass(baseclass):)

* A class with multiple baseclasses can be called in the format:
  subclass(baseclass1, baseclass2,etc):

* To override a method or attribute in the Parentclass, just define your own in
  the subclass., it'll take preccedence over that in the parentclass.

* All the parent attributes and methods are available to subclasses.

* Inheritance increases code reusability, makes code simpler to write and read,
  reducing maintenance expenses.
