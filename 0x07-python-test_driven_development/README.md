- Python has been really awesome so far. It doesn't bite and doesn't have much
  appetite for my tears. I'm still keeping a safe distance as I don't want to be
  constricted lol.

- Interactive testing, also known as manual testing is tesing that is done with
  no form of automation(i.e manually). Direct interaction is key in such tests.

- The importance of tests cannot be over-emphasized. From ensuring a hitch-free
  production to protecting firms' reputation. Problems that arise after
  deployment are expensive and dangerous, hence the needadequate tests after
  production.

- There are quite a number of ways to use Docstrings to create tests;
  Within the module in form of comments
  In a separate module with extension .py(python file)
  In a separate directory with extension .txt(text file)

- Documentation...

- The basic flags for creating tests are -m -v

- Edge cases must also be covered as they could otherwise compromise quality
  of the program and possibly create vunerabilities for attacks...
