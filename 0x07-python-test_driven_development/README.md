###   Python - Test-driven development
* Python is awesome! It has provisions for multiple forms of testing.

* An interactive test is a manual test involving user input and expected output

* A non-interactive test is an automated test.

* Tests are important for every piece of code/software written as it helps in
  bug detection, code efficiency, and the overall performance of the software.

* Docstrings are one of the available testing methods provided by Python. It is
  very advantageous to other testing methods in small-scale scenarios.

* Edge cases are very important as it tracks abnormalities in a code's behavior

* The flags involved in python tests include -v, -m, etc.
