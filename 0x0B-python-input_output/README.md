### Python Input-Output

* Python is awesome! It supports reading and writing of files as well as JSON
  data manipulation.

* The **open('filename', 'mode', encoding)** method allows us to open files.

* The **write()** method allows writing of a file.

* The **readlines()** method reads all the lines in a file.

* The **readline()** method reads a file line by line.

* The **seek()** methos moves the cursor in a file.

* The **with** keyword makes sure a file is closed after using it.

* JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data interchange format. It
  takes data and reconstructs it to string representations.

* Serialization: Python Data -> JSON format
  This is done by using the json.dumps() method or json.dump() to convert to an
  object file.

* Deserialization: JSON format -> Python Data
  This is done by using the json.loads() method.
