Python is Awesome!

* Pyhton has a builtin function open() which returns a file object.

* In Python, we use the write method to write a string into a file.

* The read() method reads the full content of a file. This carries some risk as
  you're on your own if the file to be read is bigger than the system's memory.

* It is safer to read the contents of a file by line with the readline() method
  with a simple for loop.

* The seek(offset, whence) method moces the cursor position to offest + whence

* Using the with keyword before making file operations ensures the files are
  closed at the end of the operations.

* JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is a format of code that allows for transfer
  of data between software or applications.

* serialization is a term used in JSON for converting data to string format.
* deserialization is the reconstructing of the data from the string format.
