Python is awesome!

Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm that involves the
use of clases, objects, instances, etc in place of functional programming.

van Rossum made python such that everything in python is a "first-class" object

A class is a blueprint that defines the variables and methods that will apply
to its objects...
